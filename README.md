### What I learned

Hello everyone, I just completed the Meet Landing Page challenge! I feel that I'm gaining experience and that is allowing me to complete these challenges at a faster pace. My focus on the next project is to make sure that I organize my code so that I'm not repeating myself too much and to keep it organized so that everything runs smooth. I was excited when using CSS Grid this time for the four images. I can't believe how much easier it was to get consistent spacing, instead of using Flexbox. After a few more projects I want to try out a CSS framework. Maybe Tailwind CSS? And maybe add some animations to the designs as well. It's going to be fun, so stay tuned :D
